  Immigrants are responsible for high crime rates
According to a special July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born citizens.
Study after study has shown, however, that immigrants—regardless of where they are from, what immigration status they hold, and how much education they have completed—are less likely than native-born citizens to commit crimes or become incarcerated.
Studies have consistently found that immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans and that there was no correlation between crime rates and levels of immigration.
Immigrants don’t pay taxes
Undocumented immigrants are already taxpayers
Immigrants collectively pay between $90 and $140 billion each year in taxes, and a recent study found that undocumented immigrants alone paid more than $11.8 billion in taxes in 2012.
Immigrants are taking our jobs
Immigrants help create jobs by buying American products and they are twice as likely to start their own businesses.
In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens.  States with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment for everyone.
All undocumented immigrants sneak across the Mexican border
Although many people commonly think of undocumented immigrants as people who have snuck across the Mexican border, somewhere between one third and one half of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. have overstayed their visitor, student, or work visas. That means that they entered the U.S. with lawful documentation and only later became undocumented.
We can stop undocumented immigrants from coming into the United States by building a wall along the Mexican border
A wall along the entire border with Mexico would be impractical and very likely ineffective.  The border between the U.S. and Mexico is almost 2,000 miles long.  It spans difficult terrain, including deserts and mountains.  Rivers flow along two thirds of the border.  Much of the area is private property, which the government would have to buy from the owners to build a fence or wall, and many do not want to sell the land.  The logistics alone make building a wall very difficult, if not impossible.
