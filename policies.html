   <h3>Receiving Family-Based Immigrant Visas</h3>
   <p>
     Relatives (such as children or parents) or spouses are admitted as US citizens if one of their family members
     is a citizen. These individuals are given visas but the number of visas distributed varies each year. 
     The minimum amount of visas that the United States is permitted to give annually is 226,000. Realistically, 
     there are over 480,000 of these visas granted.

   <h3>Receiving Employment-Based Immigrant Visas</h3>
   <p>
     Some immigrants are granted visas for employment purposes, either on a temporary or permanent basis. There are 
     more than twenty types temporary visas. Additionally, around 140,000 permanent visas are given annually. This number
     includes both the visas for the immigrant workers themselves and the visas for their family members. Each permanent
     visa can be categorized under one of five preference categories. A higher preference category means that the 
     individual's skills and abilities are considered more valuable.

   <h3>Welcoming Refugees and Asylees</h3>
   <p>
     The United States grants asylum to individuals who are fleeing persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, 
     or political opinion. Asylees apply to stay in the United States, which can be done either at the port of entry 
     or within one year of arriving. There is no maximum to the number of asylees that the United States can accept each 
     year. While thousands of people apply for asylum in the United States, only a small fraction of them are accepted. In 
     2015, more than 26,000 immigrants were granted asylum. Refugees can apply for admission from a transition country 
     and the admission is based off of the degree of risk that the individual faces back in his/her native country. Unlike 
     the policy for asylees, the maximum number of refugees accepted each year is determined by the President. To put the 
     ceiling in perspective, more than 85,000 refugees were admitted in 2016.

   <h4> Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terroist Entry (Travel Ban) </h4>
   <p>
     “Muslim ban”
     Stereotype is that muslims are terrorists and that makes people afraid of muslims. However, 
     However, majority of muslims are people without bad intentions. Certain countries are banned 
     but many of these countries are not even the threat.

     Those who have permanent residence or hold visas are exempted but once their visas expire they cannot be renewed
