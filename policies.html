<h1>Current Policies in the United States</h1>
   
<h3>Family based</h3>
   <p>Immediate relatives or spouses are admitted as US citizens if their family member is a citizen
Every year the number of visas given varies. The lowest number the United States is permitted to give is 226,000, but realistically there are over 480,000 given.
  Family members are giving preferences (children, parents, and spouses) 
   </p>
   
<h3>Employment based </h3>
  <p>Immigrants that have valuable skills are given visas
Temporary and permanent visas given
More than 20 types temporary visas
140,000 permanent visas are given a year. This number includes the workers and their families.
For permanent visas, there are 5 preference categories. Depending on how valuable the United States deems your ability, the higher preference you are.
   </p>
   
<h3>Refugees/ Asylees</h3>
   <p>
     The United States grants asylum to individuals who are fleeing persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, or political opinion. In 2015, the United States granted asylum to over 26,000 immigrants. This is a small fraction of the number of refugees who apply for asylum.
They apply for admission from a transition country. The admission is based off of the degree of risk the person faces. The max number of refugees accepted is decided by the president. To put the ceiling number in perspective, in 2016 there were about 85,000 refugees admitted.
Asylees apply to stay in the United States while they are already in the United States. They can apply at the port of entry, or within one year of their entry. There is no maximum number of Asylees the United States accepts every year.

Policies relating to illegal immigration
DACA
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
Created under the Obama Administration
Allows people who were brought to the United States illegally before the age of 31 on June 15th, 2012 to study in the United States or receive work visas
Requirements
No serious criminal convictions
Either enrolled in a high school or have a high school diploma
Since implementation, about 790,000 unauthorized citizens have received work permits and deportation relief
Program expires every 2 years
Majority of the recipients are from Latin America
78% are Mexican
“Muslim ban”
Stereotype is that muslims are terrorists and that makes people afraid of muslims. However, there are many muslims that are good people. Certain countries are banned but many of these countries are not even the threat.
Created under the Trump Administration
Enforced a travel ban
Wanted to cut the number of refugees admitted into the United States from 110,000 to 50,000
Chad, Iran, Libya, Syria, venezuela, Yemen, Somalia, and North Korea are the countries that are affected
Those who have permanent residence or hold visas are exempted but once their visas expire they cannot be renewed
Refugee applicants will be capped at 45,000
Ban stays in place until the countries meet certain baseline security requirements (impossible for some countries that don’t have proper technologies)
Priorities will be given to religious minorities in said countries. 
Essentially this is a loophole for Christians
