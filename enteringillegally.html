      in 2015. It was estimated that in 2016, 100,000 more visas would be overstayed.

      The United States grants asylum to indivduals who are fleeing persecution
      due to their race, religion, nationality, or political opinion. In 2015, the 
      United States granted asylum to over 26,000 immigrants. This is a small fraction 
      of the number of refugees who apply for asylum.
