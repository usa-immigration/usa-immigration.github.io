  <h1>Why Immigration Issues Matter</h1>
   </center>
   <br>
<h3>Scientists, Engineers, and Innovators</h3>
   <p>
     Many immigrants hold college degrees, and are highly educated. According to the Census Bureau, 
     33 percent of the immigrant population with a bachelor's degree or higher are engineers while 24
     percent are physical scientists. The Partnership for a New American Economy reports that of the 10 top patent-producing
     universities, over 75% were issued to foreign-born inventors in 2011. Additionally, around 25 percent
     of public companies have been founded by immigrants. These companies include Google, eBay, Yahoo!, Intel,
     and many more.
     Between 1870 and 1920 a massive number of people immigrated from their home countries to 
   the United States, increasing Americaâ€™s midwestern industrial growth, for example, the 
   creation of Detroit automobiles and Pittsburgh steel.

<h3>Business Owners</h3>
 <p> The United States Census Bureau reports that there are roughly 27.9 million businesses in the country. A significant
   portion of these businesses are immigrant-owned. About 18 percent of the small businesses are owned by immigrants.
   Not only do immigrants own a large portion of the businesses but they are also 30% more likely to start their own business than 
   non-immigrants.

<h3>Create Jobs for American Workers</h3>
  <p>Despite what many people believe, immigrants create jobs for American workers rather than steal them. According to 
    the Fiscal Policy Institute, small businesses owned by immigrants employ around 4.7 million people and these businesses
    generate more than $776 billion in revenue per year. Research done by Professor Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, Professor of Economics at Yale University, 
    found other ways that immigration benefits the American economy. For instance, immigrants taking a low paying job, such as washing the dishes in a 
    restaurant, makes the restaurant more sustainable and viable. In the long run, this allows the owner to hire more workers, thus creating more jobs
    for American workers.
