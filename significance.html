   Why Immigration Issues Matter
  </h1></center>

Between 1870 and 1920 a massive number of people immigrated from their home countries to 
   the United States, increasing America’s midwestern industrial growth, for example, the 
   creation of Detroit automobiles and Pittsburgh steel. 
Serve cheap labor → economic growth.
   
<h3>Scientists, Engineers, and Innovators</h3>
   <p>
     Many immigrants hold college degrees, and are highly educated. According to the Census Bureau, 
     33 percent of the immigrant population with a bachelor's degree or higher are engineers while 24
     percent are physical scientists. The Partnership for a New American Economy reports that of the 10 top patent-producing
     universities, over 75% were issued to foreign-born inventors in 2011. Additionally, around 25 percent
     of public companies have been founded by immigrants. These companies include Google, eBay, Yahoo!, Intel,
     and many more.
   </p>
   
<h3>Business Owners</h3>
 <p> The United States Census Bureau reports that there are roughly 27.9 million businesses in the country. A significant
   portion of these businesses are immigrant-owned. About 18 percent of the smalll buisinesses are owned by immigrants.
   Not only do immigrants own a large portion of the buisinesses but they are also 30% more likely to start their own buisiness than 
   non-immigrants.

<h3>Create Jobs for American Workers</h3>
  <p>According to the Fiscal Policy Institute, small businesses owned by immigrants employed an estimated 
   4.7 million people in 2007, and according to the latest estimates, these small businesses generated 
   more than $776 billion annually.
