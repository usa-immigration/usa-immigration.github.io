   Why Immigration Issues Matter
  </h1></center>

Between 1870 and 1920 a massive number of people immigrated from their home countries to 
   the United States, increasing America’s midwestern industrial growth, for example, the 
   creation of Detroit automobiles and Pittsburgh steel. 
Serve cheap labor → economic growth.

     of the population with bachelor's degrees or higher. According to the Census Bureau, 33 percent

   despite making up only 16 percent of the resident population holding a bachelor’s degree or higher,
   immigrants represent 33 percent of engineers, 27 percent of mathematicians, statisticians,
   and computer scientist, and 24 percent of physical scientists. Additionally, according to the 
   Partnership for a New American Economy, in 2011, foreign-born inventors were credited with 
   contributing to more than 75 percent of patents issued to the top 10 patent-producing universities.

   U.S. companies that were backed by venture capital investors. This list includes Google, eBay, Yahoo!,

   business in the United States than non-immigrants, and 18 percent of all small business owners 
   in the United States are immigrants.</p>
